            <h1>A little about me...</h1>
            <p>Hey again, it's me <strong>Emilia</strong>; you clicked here because you want to learn a bit more about me as a human. That's <em>super awesome</em>, allow me to introduce myself.</p>
            <p>I am in my third year of Civil Engineering and Society and loving every minute of it (minus a couple minutes for last second lab reports and crazy long trips to the ADL). I love my department so much it prompted me to get involved in the Civil Society and subsequently the MES. I went from being a first year who never left Thode under any circumstances to a person who really cares for their department and faculty. I became a person who wants to look at the bigger picture of what McMaster Engineering students need and I feel extremely fulfilled with my involvement so far.</p>
            <p>This year I was (and still am until SAGM 2, <em>come to SAGM!!!</em>) able to serve the Civil engineering students as the MES Civil rep. It was really fulfilling to have people approach me with their questions, attend council meetings and become the liaison between the MES and the civil engineering society. I also currently sit as the <strong>VP Memes</strong> on the Civil society and although you probably think its a fake position, making memes to promote our events taught me a lot about communications. Advertisements need to be eye catching and entertaining to leave a mark and I believe my time served making memes for the Civil Society will really help me as VP Comms.</p>
            <p>Other than school, I really love <span class="Wes">Wes Anderson</span> movies, Ruffles sour cream and onion chips and the beautiful city of <strong>Brampton</strong> (birthplace of the one and only Michael Cera).</p>
