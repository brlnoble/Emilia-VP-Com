                <h1>Fixing the website home page</h1>
                <p>Currently our<a href="https://www.macengsociety.ca/" target="_blank"><u>macengsociety.ca</u></a>homepage is severely lacking in any introductory information (love the events calendar though). </p>
                <p>This is extremely unhelpful for first time users of the site and offers no context into what the MES actually is at first glance. I want to update the front page of the MES website to include some basic yet extremely valuable information. I want to see some background on our current society’s values, context into our history and a bunch of student faces without needing to click through multiple pages.</p>
                <p>Let's give people something to look at on our front page!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mainText" id="plat2">
                <h1>Putting a face to the name for every MES position</h1>
                <p>I’m not really the biggest fan of the fact that under the “our team” section of the MES website only the Executives and Associate Vice President are showcased. I understand we don’t want to clog up the page, however the fact is the MES team isn’t just the executives.</p>
                <p>I really want to see every department, program, and appointed position member get a small photo next to their name and be recognized under the “our team” sub page. I believe students will find it much easier reaching out to someone knowing what they look like, and it showcases just how many people it takes to help the MES run smoothly.</p>

            <div class="mainText" id="plat3">
                <h1>Give the department/program societies some love</h1>
                <p>Hundreds of awesome events are run annually by all the department and program societies which get a ton of help from the MES.</p>
                <p>Being on the civil society for the past 2 years, I can attest to the fact that without funding from the MES we wouldn’t be a functioning society. The MES should be proud of the awesome work all it’s sub societies do and let students know that they aren’t separate from the MES. I want to create a page on the website dedicated to showcasing all our awesome student societies and their presidents.</p>

            <div class="mainText" id="plat4">
                <h1>MES Student of the week</h1>
                <p>We should be celebrating a ton more students besides just the small fraction that make up the MES appointed/elected positions.</p>
                <p>I want a new student on the front page every week, showcasing how the MES has positively affected them. Be that a first year who found the MES help sessions super informative, a student who attended fireball for the first time and loved every minute of it or the delegates from the conference on sustainability explaining what they learned from the experience. I want a small section of the website to show how many students the MES effects on a regular basis.</p>
                <p>People tend to think the MES is a bubble of a few dozen students, l want to prove them wrong and proudly display just how many people we help!</p>

            <div class="mainText">
                <h1>Print and plant policy</h1>
                <p>I understand poster printing is a highly effective form of advertising however in light of the growing climate crisis we as the MES should set standards on the amount we print. As VP comms I want to work directly with the Sustainability committee and set hard limits on the amount each event, club, and team has for printing advertisements.</p>
                <p>I want all the printing we do to be kept on record so we can track our levels and at the end of the year directly offset our printing emissions by planting trees.</p>
